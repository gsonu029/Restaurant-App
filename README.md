# Overview of App
This App displays the list of Cuisines in a perticular city

In this App user has to enter a City ID as an input then after clicking the search button list of cuisines will be displayed of the given City ID on the screen in a scrollable list.
I have used Zomato-API for getting the cuisines data and I have used OkHttp for network applications.
